## Professional proficiency


### Communication
From Sprint 1, since all group members were in similar classes, it was fairly easy to communicate with each other. Generally we discussed about how far the other members did in the project.

I realised that it was not efficient communication through Sprint 2 and 3 because the communication was not affecting the work flow and time management. We all discussed about it then not doing the work properly in time, because we all shared similar assignments from other courses, make it acceptable to slack a bit on project.

I am the one of the member who struggled with heavy workload therefore I have to admit that I slacked a bit during Sprint 1 and 2. I tried to finish mine in time and nearly finished, but still not enough to say I completed the tasks.

Image below shows that struggling before I acknowledge the importance of communication, by delayed works.

Also I did not communicate through a github with other members because we communicated face-to-face. It was unprofessional. I did not know the importance of communication through professional window, and so other members and I showed each other’s progress and closed the issue that each other finished.

Image below shows a big improvement after I tried to communicate with other members in more professional manner.

It was huge mistake as a lot of works during that time, Sprint 1 and 2, were not reviewed thoroughly to other members as well as to customer, and therefore most of the works were thrown away or need to be done again. We did not pursue the agile principle way. 

This also caused another problem and it was inconsistency between code writers. For instance, I could not read and understand other member’s code straight away because I assumed they will write codes like I do, and just checked the appearance of result rather than codes itself.

However, I gradually learned the importance of professional communication through those mistakes. I tried to use github more usefully, as it suggested, and tried to communicate with other members, focused on project work only

These images are evidences that shows my effort to make a healthy communication through github and facebook chat, outside of class.

This simple change made my working pace faster because it smoothed the working flow between group members. The project sufficiently improved my ability to communicate with other people and be professional about work.

### Leadership

I do not have an outgoing personality and do not like to step up to the other people. I tried to become just one of the group members and do my own work if someone stands as a leader and assign work for me.

The part that I did not know was that every other people feels similar way as well. As much as it makes me hard, every other people felt same pressure and awkwardness from being a leader.

Those facts lead our group work without leader and it was not efficient. We all discussed about project such as who will do certain issue by waiting for volunteer and it reduced both motivation and time to work on it.

As an old member of the group, members tried to ask my opinion all the matters and I struggled with it because I never worked as a leader, in this big group. It was stressful so I tried to avoid lead them and rather ask opinions of other members and approving those ideas.

The aftereffect of absent of leadership gradually slowed my group down and I realised that someone should be a leader, to motivate other members as well as get the works done. After failure to finish Sprint 1, 2 and 3, all the members felt the need of work more efficiently, I tried to lead other members. It was not easy and I could not lead members like I thought I imagined, but tried to lead other members.
