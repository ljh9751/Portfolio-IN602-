# Portfolio -IN602- (Written by Joon ho Lee)

## Professional proficiency

### Communication
From Sprint 1, since all group members were in similar classes, it was fairly easy to communicate with each other. Generally we discussed about how far the other members did in the project.

I realised that it was not efficient communication through Sprint 2 and 3 because the communication was not affecting the work flow and time management. We all discussed about it then not doing the work properly in time, because we all shared similar assignments from other courses, make it acceptable to slack a bit on project.

I am the one of the member who struggled with heavy workload therefore I have to admit that I slacked a bit during Sprint 1 and 2. I tried to finish mine in time and nearly finished, but still not enough to say I completed the tasks.
