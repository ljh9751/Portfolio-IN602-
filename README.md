## Professional proficiency


### Communication
From Sprint 1, since all group members were in similar classes, it was fairly easy to communicate with each other. Generally we discussed about how far the other members did in the project.

I realised that it was not efficient communication through Sprint 2 and 3 because the communication was not affecting the work flow and time management. We all discussed about it then not doing the work properly in time, because we all shared similar assignments from other courses, make it acceptable to slack a bit on project.

I am the one of the member who struggled with heavy workload therefore I have to admit that I slacked a bit during Sprint 1 and 2. I tried to finish mine in time and nearly finished, but still not enough to say I completed the tasks.

Image below shows that struggling before I acknowledge the importance of communication, by delayed works.

Also I did not communicate through a github with other members because we communicated face-to-face. It was unprofessional. I did not know the importance of communication through professional window, and so other members and I showed each other’s progress and closed the issue that each other finished.

Image below shows a big improvement after I tried to communicate with other members in more professional manner.

It was huge mistake as a lot of works during that time, Sprint 1 and 2, were not reviewed thoroughly to other members as well as to customer, and therefore most of the works were thrown away or need to be done again. We did not pursue the agile principle way. 

This also caused another problem and it was inconsistency between code writers. For instance, I could not read and understand other member’s code straight away because I assumed they will write codes like I do, and just checked the appearance of result rather than codes itself.

However, I gradually learned the importance of professional communication through those mistakes. I tried to use github more usefully, as it suggested, and tried to communicate with other members, focused on project work only

These images are evidences that shows my effort to make a healthy communication through github and facebook chat, outside of class.

This simple change made my working pace faster because it smoothed the working flow between group members. The project sufficiently improved my ability to communicate with other people and be professional about work.

### Leadership

I do not have an outgoing personality and do not like to step up to the other people. I tried to become just one of the group members and do my own work if someone stands as a leader and assign work for me.

The part that I did not know was that every other people feels similar way as well. As much as it makes me hard, every other people felt same pressure and awkwardness from being a leader.

Those facts lead our group work without leader and it was not efficient. We all discussed about project such as who will do certain issue by waiting for volunteer and it reduced both motivation and time to work on it.

As an old member of the group, members tried to ask my opinion all the matters and I struggled with it because I never worked as a leader, in this big group. It was stressful so I tried to avoid lead them and rather ask opinions of other members and approving those ideas.

The aftereffect of absent of leadership gradually slowed my group down and I realised that someone should be a leader, to motivate other members as well as get the works done. After failure to finish Sprint 1, 2 and 3, all the members felt the need of work more efficiently, I tried to lead other members. It was not easy and I could not lead members like I thought I imagined, but tried to lead other members.

Images above shows the improvement of my leadership, which needs more improvement.

### Teamwork
From Sprint 1 to 3, I was not participate with other members because I thought all I need to do was working on my part of project and wait for other members’ completion. I only focused on my work and its due date, and did not cared much about work of others.

But when we reached Sprint 4, I noticed that it was not agile way of working. If one part of work fails to meet the criteria on time, the whole process delays because of it. The member who did not finish in time will have to work on other issue, which will make both works hard to finish on time, results on not finishing next Sprint as well.

This actually happened to all the members of the group which led us to not finish both Sprint 2, 3, and 4. I had a hard time to finish all my delayed issues while finishing newly assigned work.

From that experience, I learned that as a team member, I need to help other members as well to improve the work efficiency of overall group.

I presents small portion of group chat from facebook chat dedicated to IN602.

Other member may felt same way because from Sprint 5, everyone worked on their issue and helping other members through improved communication which results in finishing Sprint 5 and 6 successfully, finishing on time.

### Time management

Time management was the largest problem for our group. We could not finish the works in time and it made us not finishing the Sprints in time.

On my defence, I only did not finish my work on Sprint 1 and finished every work from then.
But it was not efficient because I finished my works on deadline and did not proof read codes well as reviewing them with other members. It looked good as I finished the works on time but it was actually wasting times to improve myself and my works.

I learned that finishing the works on time is not important, in terms of time management. Time management that I know now, is using the given time in most efficiently as possible, without wasting any of it. I acknowledged during after Sprint 4 and tried to be at my best on time managing.

These images as well as images for communication shows my improvement on time managing.

### Motivating self and others
Throughout the project, I tried to provide the motivation to other group members, as they ask my opinion, like “Everything is okay” or “Nothing to worry about it”. It was just words that I generally says when I am trying to make the problem less stressful.

It turned out not efficient since it lowered tension of the workflow. As I showed my confidence on something that I did not know and care much about it seems made other members to lose their focus. It also lowered my motivation as well because I was not telling the truth. I falsely made all the hard obstacles to low obstacle and postponed it to later.

What I learned about this experience is that motivating others is not all about cheering them up and treat the problem as if it is nothing. Assume the obstacle harder is not good but other way around was not good either.

I learned that to motivate others in right way, the balance between those two factors above is the most important. I failed to motivate myself and others during most of the time in this project but near the end, every member motivated each other well enough to finish the basic functions for whole project in short amount of time.
