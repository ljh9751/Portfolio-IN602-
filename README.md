## Professional proficiency

### Communication
From Sprint 1, since all group members were in similar classes, it was fairly easy to communicate with each other. Generally we discussed about how far the other members did in the project.

I realised that it was not efficient communication through Sprint 2 and 3 because the communication was not affecting the work flow and time management. We all discussed about it then not doing the work properly in time, because we all shared similar assignments from other courses, make it acceptable to slack a bit on project.

I am the one of the member who struggled with heavy workload therefore I have to admit that I slacked a bit during Sprint 1 and 2. I tried to finish mine in time and nearly finished, but still not enough to say I completed the tasks.

Image below shows that strugling before I acknowledge the importance of communication, by delayed works.

Also I did not communicate through a github with other members because we communicated face-to-face. It was unprofessional. I did not know the importance of communication through professional window, and so other members and I showed each other’s progress and closed the issue that each other finished.

Image below shows a big improvement after I tried to communicate with other members in more professional manner.

It was huge mistake as a lot of works during that time, Sprint 1 and 2, were not reviewed thoroughly to other members as well as to customer, and therefore most of the works were thrown away or need to be done again. We did not pursue the agile principle way. 

This also caused another problem and it was inconsistency between code writers. For instance, I could not read and understand other member’s code straight away because I assumed they will write codes like I do, and just checked the appearance of result rather than codes itself.

However, I gradually learned the importance of professional communication through those mistakes. I tried to use github more usefully, as it suggested, and tried to communicate with other members, focused on project work only

These images are evidences that shows my effort to make a healthy communication through github and facebook chat, outside of class.

This simple change made my working pace faster because it smoothed the working flow between group members. The project sufficiently improved my ability to communicate with other people and be professional about work.
